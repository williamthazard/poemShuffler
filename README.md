poem shuffler

**note: requires having lua installed on your computer**

put the text you want to shuffle in `original.txt`. Then, from your terminal of choice, `cd` into the folder where you've stored the files in this repository and run `lua poemShuffler.lua`. Your shuffled poem will appear in `scramble.txt`. Note that this program replaces whatever is already in `scramble.txt`. Be sure to move anything you want to keep to a different file before running poemShuffler again!
