Spare me, O queen, this agony and anguish,
And heeding, thou hast come, leaving thy father's
Fluttering swift pinions over earth's darkness,
And bringing thee through the infinite, gliding
Daughter of Zeus, Enchantress, I implore thee,
With divine contenance smiling, didst ask me
     Crush not my spiritWhenever before thou has hearkened to me--
     Downwards from heaven,Then, soon they arrived and thou, blessed goddess,
What new woe had befallen me now and why,
Shimmering-throned immortal Aphrodite,
     Golden dominions,With chariot yoked to thy fleet-winged coursers,
     Thus I had called the.
To my voice calling to thee in the distance,
